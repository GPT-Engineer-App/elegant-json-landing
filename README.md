# elegant-json-landing

A minimal, but elegant looking landing page. Ideally the landing page would look like it is formatted as a JSON file like the following:
{
    "0KB.ORG": {
        "error": false,
        "packet-size": "0KB",
        "response": "Coming soon...",
        "site": "https://0KB.org",
        "domain-admin": "0@0KB.ORG"
    },
    "Contact": {
        "telegram": "https://t.me/zerokilobytes",
        "site": "https://johnle.org",
        "github": "https://github.com/9-5",
        "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/johnle",
        "email": "john@johnle.org"
    },
    "Projects": {
        "portfolio": "Coming soon."
    }
}
